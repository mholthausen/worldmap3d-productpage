WorldMap3D is a project by [terrestris](https://www.terrestris.de/en/) from Bonn, Germany, to visualize three-dimensional data structures on a digital globe. WorldMap3D is based on the OpenSource Framework [CesiumJS](https://cesium.com/platform/cesiumjs/). Like a conventional globe, it is a simplified representation of the real world. And, as familiar with 2D map representations, any region can be displayed with much more precise detail than it would be possible with a conventional globe.
