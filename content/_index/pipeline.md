Our pipeline allows the conversion of two-dimensional, text-based data into 3D objects via the free exchange format glTF into Cesium 3D Tiles to view them in the 3D viewer. These data can be displayed on the globes surface or in its interior. This especially enables the visualization of the conditions in the subsurface to answer geological questions.
